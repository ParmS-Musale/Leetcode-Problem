// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [10,4,-8,7]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
// - Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
// - Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
// - Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
// Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.
